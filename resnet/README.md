# ResNet

The [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385) architecture introduced the idea of a residual connection in neural networks. This idea allowed much deeper networks to be trained. Prior to residual layers, nets would no longer learn as the number of layers increased past a certain point. The problem was not due to overfitting.
